          experience in creating beautiful and responsive websites. I specialize
          in <span>Next.js</span>, a React framework that enables fast and
          SEO-friendly web development. I also have strong skills in{" "}
          <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and
          Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework that helps me design stunning
          layouts. I&apos;m passionate about learning new technologies and best
          practices, and I always strive to deliver high-quality code and user
          experience. Whether you need a landing page, a blog, an e-commerce
          site, or anything in between, I can help you turn your vision into
          reality.
